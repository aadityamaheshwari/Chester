          <p id="letter">Dear Chester,
            <br> <br>
            You will always be alive in my memories, in the amazing music, songs & lyrics that you've given me & the world to live with. 
            <br> <br>
            You've touched millions of peoples, their lives in ways you wouldn't know, helped me & several others in ways you can hardly imagine. There is that music, those songs & lyrics which very often fit so perfectly in so many situations & help me push through. I often feel that we share those demons that you always spoke about & sang about.
            <br> <br>
            The way you sang like a legend, screamed like an angel, lyrics so true & genuine to life & its quirks, will forever remain like an echo in my ears. I will always remember you & LP as the way you were. LP will forever be my favorite band for my so called journey of music began with LP. Thanks for the awesome music, songs & lyrics.  Thank you for that gift. I love you, & miss you a lot.
            <br> <br>
            Until I see you again, very soon.
            <br> <br>
